# The Neurotransmitter Storm: An AI Researcher's Ketamine Experiment

## The Context
*I had just arrived in Germany from Istanbul. It was my second day. I was very unhappy there actually. My cousin had ketamine. I said, "Can I use it?" He gave me one thick line. It was like a mountain.*

## The Experience
*My initial feeling was so shit. The vomit feeling came immediately. I couldn't even walk, I couldn't even talk. I was so motivated to vomit that I believed so much that this vomit would fix everything. I was vomiting all the McDonald's from 30 minutes before. My stomach was feeling so sour. Everything was awful.*

## The Neuroscience Behind the Experience

### Glutamate & NMDA Receptors
Ketamine primarily works as an NMDA receptor antagonist, blocking glutamate transmission. This creates the dissociative state by disrupting communication between brain regions.

### Dopamine Pathways
The drug indirectly affects dopamine systems, contributing to both potential euphoria and the compulsive "motivation" I felt during the vomiting episode.

### Stress Response Cascade
The overwhelming experience triggered a massive sympathetic nervous system activation, flooding my body with cortisol and adrenaline.

## The Unexpected Insight
*I was feeling like I was making all this stress, all this overwhelming out. I was feeling like a human in the loop for all AI. And I was making it out to the toilet. I was vomiting all this feeling.*

## Aftermath
*Right now I feel less stressed. I feel more focused on myself. External factors make me less stressful right now. My brain has a new benchmark.*

## Conversation Summary
Our discussion explored the neuroscience behind your ketamine experience, examining how the drug's disruption of glutamate systems and subsequent stress response cascade created both the physical vomiting and psychological release you described. We connected your feeling of being an "AI human-in-the-loop" to the Default Mode Network's uncontrolled activation when executive functions were suppressed.
